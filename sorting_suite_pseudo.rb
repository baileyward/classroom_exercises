# create an array of numbers
# count how many numbers are in that array
# go through each number one by one so we can compare each number to each other.
# determine if number is bigger or smaller than the one next to it.
# find a way to swtich them with each other if needed.
# print out list to double checkx




First - create a method (sort) to take an array of numbers by passing (array)
as the agrument.
Second - Then find out how many items are in that array by calling .length and
setting that equal to a variable so we can call it throughout the program.
Third - Create a loop for the array that lets us go through each number one by one.
Do this by using the variable we created (.length) and .times and do.
Fourth - For each number in the array we want to check if the number we are on is larger
or smaller than the next number. by using array[i] > array[i]
Fifth - Find a way to swap them if they need to be.
Sixth - Print out the final list/array and end program by breaking the loop.
